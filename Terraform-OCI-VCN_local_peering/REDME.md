This topic is about local VCN peering. In this case, local means that the VCNs reside in the same region. Local VCN peering is the process of connecting two VCNs in the same region so that their resources can communicate using private IP addresses without routing the traffic over the internet or through your on-premises network. The VCNs can be in the same Oracle Cloud Infrastructure tenancy or different ones. Without peering, a given VCN would need an internet gateway and public IP addresses for the instances that need to communicate with another VCN. At a high level, the Networking service components required for a local peering include:

Two VCNs with non-overlapping CIDRs, in the same region A local peering gateway (LPG) on each VCN in the peering relationship. A connection between those two LPGs. Supporting route rules to enable traffic to flow over the connection, and only to and from select subnets in the respective VCNs (if desired). Supporting security rules to control the types of traffic allowed to and from the instances in the subnets that need to communicate with the other VCN. The following diagram illustrates the components. https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Resources/Images/network_local_peering_basic.png

This image shows the basic layout of two VCNs that are locally peered, each with a local peering gateway.
